8x8\_led\_matrix
================

A project were im using:

-8x8 bi color led matrix without PCB controller

-Arduino Timer interrupts

Material:

-1 Arduino(Nano or other, remember to change the pins used)

-1 decoder 3 to 8 negative logical

-1 decoder 3 to 8 positive logical(or negative logical + 8 NOTs)

-8x8 Led matrix

-8 1k Ohm resistors( 400 \<-\> 1000 Ohm )
